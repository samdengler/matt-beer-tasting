      <h2>Vary</h2>
      <div class="meta">Halfway Crooks &middot; Czech Pilsner &middot; 5.0%</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <h3>The Brewery</h3>
    <p>Halfway Crooks is in Summerhill, Atlanta — on the site of the old Olympic stadium. The name comes from Mobb Deep's "Shook Ones Pt. II": <em>"ain't no such thing as halfway crooks."</em> Translation: these guys don't cut corners.</p>
    <p>Founded by three unlikely partners: a <strong>Georgia Tech engineer</strong>, a <strong>Belgian sheep farmer's son</strong> who went to brewing school (his uncle is the legendary former brewmaster of New Belgium), and a <strong>retired ER doctor</strong>. They met at Brick Store Pub bonding over Belgian beer, became roommates, and started brewing in a basement.</p>

    <h3>Why This Beer</h3>
    <p>We're starting light and classic. Before 1842, beer in the Czech city of Plze&#x148; was so bad that townspeople <strong>dumped 36 barrels in front of City Hall</strong> in protest. The city hired a Bavarian to fix it. He combined Plze&#x148;'s impossibly soft water, pale malt, and local Saaz hops — and accidentally invented the world's first golden lager. People lost their minds. Up until then, basically all beer was dark and cloudy.</p>
    <p>"Vary" is a nod to <strong>Karlovy Vary</strong>, the famous Czech spa town — but also to "var," a programming variable (the engineer co-founder's fingerprint). They <strong>super-boil</strong> this one — an old Czech technique where you pull part of the mash out, boil it violently, and add it back. Way more work. Develops the honey and shortbread character you'll taste.</p>

    <p class="kicker">Tell them: "This is the beer that started a revolution in 1842. Taste that bread crust and honey sweetness — that's what happens when you do things the hard way."</p>

      <h2>Mavy</h2>
      <div class="meta">Halfway Crooks &middot; Czech Dark Lager &middot; 4.8%</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <h3>The Plot Twist</h3>
    <p>Still at Halfway Crooks. Mavy is the dark side of their Czech obsession — same Saaz hops, same Bohemian malt and yeast, same Atlanta soft water, same kräusening, same long lagering. But here they use <strong>roasted and unroasted Bohemian malts</strong> for that deep color and chocolate character.</p>

    <h3>The Surprise</h3>
    <p>Here's the thing: despite being <strong>nearly black, this is a light-bodied, easy-drinking beer</strong>. Czech dark lagers are not stouts. They're elegant and restrained — soft chocolate, slightly floral, plush body. Think of it as <strong>a pilsner in a tuxedo</strong>.</p>
    <p>The full Czech name for this style is <strong>"tmav&yacute; le&#x17E;&aacute;k"</strong> — which just means "dark lager." Nearly every Czech brewery makes one, but almost nobody in the US does. This is one of the most <strong>underappreciated styles in the world</strong>.</p>

    <h3>The Foam</h3>
    <p>In Czech beer culture, the foam (<strong>"p&#x11B;na"</strong>) is considered essential. Some pours are almost entirely foam — that's called a <strong>"ml&iacute;ko" (milk) pour</strong>. The foam is meant to be creamy, thick, and part of the experience, not just something sitting on top of your beer.</p>

    <p class="kicker">Tell them: "If Vary was the light side, this is the dark side. Same obsessive process, totally different beer. It looks like a stout but drinks like a pilsner that put on a tuxedo."</p>

      <h2>Memory</h2>
      <div class="meta">Halfway Crooks &middot; Saison &middot; 7.1%</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <h3>The Style</h3>
    <p>"Saison" means "season" in French. These were brewed on Belgian farms for <strong>field workers to drink during harvest</strong>. Before clean water was reliable, low-alcohol beer was the safe option. The originals were probably 3-4% — just enough to kill bacteria, not enough to have your workers falling into the thresher.</p>
    <p>Saison yeast is the star — it's aggressive, hungry, and produces that signature <strong>peppery, fruity character</strong>. Ask ten brewers to define saison and you'll get twelve answers. Every farm made their own version with whatever they had.</p>

    <h3>Why This Beer</h3>
    <p>This is Halfway Crooks' other side — their mixed-fermentation program. Memory is <strong>foeder-aged</strong>: aged in a huge oak vessel (think wine barrel's big brother) where wild yeast and bacteria slowly develop complex, funky flavors. Then <strong>re-fermented on Georgia peaches from Pearson Farm</strong> in Fort Valley — a real place, real peaches, not flavoring.</p>
    <p>When beer people say "funky," they mean <strong>Brettanomyces</strong> — a wild yeast most brewers consider a contaminant. It produces flavors like barnyard, leather, wet hay. Sounds terrible. Tastes incredible here. The peach and the funk meet somewhere beautiful.</p>
    <p>There's a companion beer called <strong>"Seconds"</strong> — made with the same peaches after they've already been used for Memory. Literally the leftovers. Still great.</p>

    <p class="kicker">Tell them: "This one's alive. The yeast that makes it funky would ruin most beers. Here it's the whole point. If the pilsner was a sharp suit, this is barefoot in a field."</p>

      <h2>Cowpoke</h2>
      <div class="meta">Inner Voice &middot; West Coast IPA &middot; 6.5%</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <h3>The Brewery</h3>
    <p>Inner Voice is in downtown Decatur, founded by <strong>Rhett Caseman and Josh Johnson</strong> — both former brewers at Monday Night Brewing. The name comes from a <strong>Funkadelic deep cut</strong>: George Clinton's "Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts" — <em>"Listen to the inner voice."</em> They listened, quit their jobs, and signed a lease in <strong>January 2020</strong>. Then COVID happened. They finally opened in September 2021.</p>

    <h3>The Style</h3>
    <p>West Coast IPA is the <strong>OG of the craft beer revolution</strong>. Before hazy IPAs took over, this was THE style — clear, bitter, piney, resinous. Breweries like Stone, Russian River, and Ballast Point in San Diego built an entire movement on it in the 2000s.</p>
    <p>After three lagers and a saison, this is our first hop-forward American beer. If the Czech lagers were whispers, <strong>this is a firm handshake</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Why This Beer</h3>
    <p>Cowpoke is brewed with <strong>Mosaic, Simcoe, and Citra Cryo hops</strong>. "Cryo" hops are a newer technology — they <strong>freeze-separate the lupulin</strong> (the good stuff) from the plant matter, giving you more concentrated flavor with less vegetal harshness.</p>
    <p>The difference you'll taste versus a hazy: this one <strong>finishes dry and clean</strong> with a firm bitterness. It's transparent, not murky. Old school meets new technique. Inner Voice also uses a <strong>custom direct-fire brewhouse</strong> — the flame literally hits the kettle — which is unusual for a small brewery.</p>

    <p class="kicker">Tell them: "Two guys named their brewery after a Funkadelic lyric, quit their jobs right before a pandemic, and use freeze-separated hops. This is the OG IPA style that started a revolution — clear, bitter, no apologies."</p>

      <h2>Mango Lassi Sunset</h2>
      <div class="meta">Inner Voice &middot; Smoothie Sour &middot; 6.0%</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <h3>What Is This</h3>
    <p>Okay, this is the wild card. A <strong>"smoothie sour"</strong> is exactly what it sounds like — a sour beer blended with absurd amounts of fruit puree until it has the consistency of, well, a smoothie. This is the most polarizing style in craft beer right now. Beer purists hate it. Everyone else loves it.</p>
    <p>This one is inspired by a <strong>mango lassi</strong> — the Indian yogurt drink. Loaded with mango puree and fresh coconut. Tropical, tart, creamy. It's basically a cocktail pretending to be a beer.</p>

    <h3>The Context</h3>
    <p>Inner Voice makes a bigger version called <strong>Mega Mondo Mango Lassi at 8%</strong> that won an <strong>Untappd Silver Award in 2025</strong>. This is the 6% "sessionable" take — same concept, slightly less danger.</p>
    <p>The smoothie sour trend emerged around 2018-2019 and divided the beer world in half. Some brewers think it's an abomination. Others think it's the most exciting thing to happen to beer in decades. The argument is essentially: <strong>does it have to taste like "beer" to be beer?</strong></p>

    <h3>Why It's Here</h3>
    <p>After a Czech lager, an English bitter, a farmhouse saison, and a hazy IPA, we needed something that blows up the format. This is that beer. It's also a crowd-pleaser — the person at this table who says "I don't really like beer" is about to have their mind changed.</p>

    <p class="kicker">Tell them: "If someone tells you this isn't real beer, tell them neither was pilsner in 1841. Every great style started as something that annoyed the old guard."</p>

      <h2>Perennial Abraxas</h2>
      <div class="meta">Perennial Artisan Ales &middot; Imperial Stout &middot; 10%</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="notes">
    <h3>The Legend</h3>
    <p>This is one of the most famous beers in America. <strong>99 out of 100 on BeerAdvocate</strong> (the barrel-aged version has a perfect 100). It basically <strong>invented the "pastry stout" trend</strong> that took over craft beer.</p>
    <p>The name came to founder Phil Wymore <strong>in a dream</strong>, inspired by the Santana album <em>Abraxas</em>, which was named after a Hermann Hesse novel, which referenced an <strong>ancient Gnostic deity who rules 365 heavens</strong> — one for each day of the year. That's three layers of cool.</p>

    <h3>The Origin</h3>
    <p>Before Perennial even opened, Wymore ran a blog contest asking fans what beer they wanted him to brew. Someone submitted <strong>"Mexican Chocolate Stout."</strong> Wymore built the recipe: <strong>ancho chili, cacao nibs, vanilla beans, cinnamon</strong>. The challenge was making each ingredient impactful without any one dominating. When it debuted at a St. Louis tasting event, people kept telling the organizers it was the best thing there. Fans were trading bottles nationally before the brewery even had distribution.</p>

    <h3>The Birthday Closer</h3>
    <p>Wymore trained at <strong>Goose Island</strong> under the barrel program that created Bourbon County Stout, then went and made a beer that rivals it. There's an annual <strong>Abraxas Week</strong> in St. Louis with variant releases — coffee, vanilla, maple, barrel-aged. The original still accounts for 9% of everything they brew, a decade later.</p>
    <p>This is 10% ABV. It tastes like <strong>Mexican hot chocolate in a glass</strong>. The chili warmth hits at the end. This is how you close a birthday tasting.</p>

    <p class="kicker">Tell them: "A fan literally invented this beer in a blog comment. The name came in a dream. It has a near-perfect score out of three thousand reviews. Happy birthday, Matt."</p>
